gallery.py
===============

What is it?
----------
gallery.py is a thin wrapper around ImageMagick that creates sane looking image galleries from a directory of images. You'll need ImageMagick installed and the "convert" command somewhere on your path to use it.

To see it in action, clone this repository and run:
    
    ./gallery.py /path/to/images

Example
-------

Check out [fr.ac.tl/yosemite](http://fr.ac.tl/yosemite).

Caveats
-------
This is not a full featured solution like JAlbum (jalbum.net). It does, however, let you make galleries in less than a day. If you want customizability you should either a) edit the code, or b) learn to use JAlbum.
